	'''
	This function returns a set of scaled images known as the image
	pyramid, the initial image is downscaled by a certain scale until 
	the minimum size of the image is reached. 
	Args:
		image(numpy.array): Initial image as a numpy array.
		scale(float): Scale to perform the sequential downsamplings.
		minSize(tuple): (x,y) for the smallest image of the pyramid

	Returns:
		pyramid(list[numpy.array]): List of images as numpy arrays.

def sliding_window(image, stepSize, windowSize):
	'''
	This function returns a set of windows or regions of interest from 
	an image
	Args:
		image(numpy.array): Initial image as a numpy array.
		stepSize(int): Amount of Vertical and horizontal pixels to
		slide the window.
		windowSize(tuple): (x,y) for the size of the window in pixels

	Returns:
		pyramid(list[numpy.array]): List of window images as numpy arrays.
